## Available Versions

LivePerson Flutter SDK is available in two versions to cater to different needs:

1. **Main - Stable Version**: Usually one release a month.  This version attempts to keep stability without introducing breaking changes.
2. **Sample Apps - FrontEnd Version**: The sample apps are provided in various frontend languages in order to allow maximum flexibility with your frontend implementation with the Dart backend.  Note that new features are first tested in the sample apps before being released in the mainline branch. Use only as a guide for your frontend/backend implementation of Dart.
